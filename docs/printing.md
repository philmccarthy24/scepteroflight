### Printing suggestions
I used [gold filament](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/958-prusament-petg-yellow-gold-transparent-1kg.html) for the scepter body parts, and [transparent blue](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07T7MBGVL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the gems. Please see below for the various print settings I found to work:
